## A data driven approach to understand the relationship between climate and energy use
Abstract: Climate change is considered by many as one of greatest threats to humanity. Our knowledge about climate change and climate predictions are based on bottom-up approaches using earth system models. The current trend in machine learning has led to increased in research outputs using data-driven approaches to tackle the problems of climate change. Still global system analysing cause and effect of climate change based on machine learning are rare. In this dissertation, the relationship between climate and energy use is observed by creating Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average and Long Short-Term Memory models to predict temperature anomalies and absolute temperature. We demonstrate how models react to non-meteorological features like the worldwide population, the gross domestic product or emissions. The knowledge obtained from these experiments is used to propose a worldwide artificial intelligence climate network.
